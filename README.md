# Robotics Project - NWO 2021

## Points to Consider While Writing

- Scientific in nature (reviewers from other fields);
- Explore something unknown/ground-breaking;
- Relatively rapid exploration of a promising idea (9 months);
- It should be somehow related to software engineering (given our research interest).

### Ivano's Background
- Software Engineering in Regard to the Software Industry
- Mobile Apps
- Microservices
- Model-driven Engineering
- Mining Software Repositories
- Empirical Software Engineering
- Robotics


### Michel's Background
- Cloud Computing and Distributed Systems
- Distributed Software Testing
- IoT Software (researching)
- IoT Devices
- Robotics
- Educational Robotics

## Dates
- Deadline: 6 May;
- Notication: 17 June.

## Main Robot Ideas (We Must Focus on What to Research For Them)
- Covid (or other pandemic) focused - the impact of this pandemic goes to last for a while;
  - https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/oct/02/the-rise-of-the-covid-robots-in-pictures
  - Contactless (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fwijfcuwz0I);
  - Social bots (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WujARg_xqfE);
    - http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/Maggie (all its capabilities are implemented via ROS); 
    - https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/hardware_and_creative/9781783554713/3/ch03lvl1sec26/building-social-robots
  - https://hospitalityinsights.ehl.edu/robots-during-covid-19

  * For this, the it could be an exit to research about the "impact" of integrating IoT devices and Robots (IoRT).
    - Patient monitoring and robots that replace basic nursing tasks, such as delivering pills, or even taking the blood pressure.
  
  * To which extent? Have they been used for saving money?
  
  * How to improve trustness?
  
  * Humanization: how can the social connection be improved/how can a robot be used to improve children socialization.

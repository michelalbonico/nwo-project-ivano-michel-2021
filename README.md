# Robotics Project - NWO 2021

## Points to Consider While Writing

- Scientific in nature (reviewers from other fields);
- Explore something unknown/ground-breaking;
- A relatively rapid exploration of a promising idea (9-10 months);
- It should be somehow related to software engineering (given our research interest).

### Ivano's Background
- Software Engineering in Regard to the Software Industry
- Mobile Apps
- Microservices
- Model-driven Engineering
- Mining Software Repositories
- Empirical Software Engineering
- Robotics

### Michel's Background
- Cloud Computing and Distributed Systems
- Distributed Software Testing
- IoT Software (researching)
- IoT Devices
- Robotics
- Educational Robotics

### Group Focus
- Data-driven (base the decisions on software repositories - mining/SLR);
- Empirical experimentation (non-functional requirements);
- Sustainability and human factors (jobs, privacy, energy consumption, socialization, ...);
- Software architecture (which are the existing architectures).

To which extent:
- Smart cities (and environments);
- Cloud computing (offloading);
- Robotics.

Aiming at:
- Being relevant to the industry;
- Being applicable in practice.

## Dates
- Deadline: 6 May;
- Notification: 17 June.

## Main Ideas

- Robots + IoT (Smart Environments and Robots)
  - With the contactless worldwide situation, smart environments become even more interactive and necessary, where the robots play a key role. For instance, are hospitals where basic nursing tasks have been performed by machines.
  - Why IoT and robots?
    -  Simplest example: patient monitoring and robots that replace basic nursing tasks, such as delivering pills, or even taking the blood pressure.
  
  * Some robotics projects related to that:

   - Contactless (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fwijfcuwz0I)/https://twitter.com/AsOriented/status/1371399822276714497;
   - Social bots (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WujARg_xqfE);
     - http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/Maggie (all its capabilities are implemented via ROS);

   - https://hospitalityinsights.ehl.edu/robots-during-covid-19
  
  * Integrating IoT and Robotics Software (IoRT). 
   * Stupid case study:
   * Catalog case studies and robots, and experiment them;
      * Non-functional requirements.
    
  * Humanization: social connection used to improve children's socialization (a bit skewed).

- Simulating robot energy consumption (not sure it's appealing for other areas and industries).
